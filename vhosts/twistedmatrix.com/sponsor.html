<h2>What do you Mean, 'Supported'?</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.divmod.com/">Divmod corporation</a> employs several
members of the Twisted team, contributes both features and fixes to the Twisted
core on a regular basis, and participates in the larger Python community by
presenting papers and releasing many open-source projects, both standalone and
designed to integrate with Twisted.</p>

<p>A notable contribution is the IMAP4 support, whose initial development was
entirely financed by Divmod.</p>

<p>Since you asked, maybe you'd be interested in Divmod's upcoming alpha test.
Alpha testers get an opportunity to give feedback that will be integrated into
our products, and will receive service at discounted rates.  Ask a Twisted
developer to find where to get an access code, and sign up today!</p>
